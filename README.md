# GVGAI with heuristic selection

Personalised version of the GVGAI framework that allows providing the heuristic to use in the algorithm at the time of starting the game. This modification allows running an algorithm with different heuristics (behaviours) without having to update its core code.  

## Original code - GVGAI competition

The original code of the framework can be found at https://github.com/GAIGResearch/GVGAI. It has been duplicated in this repository and included some modifications to fit the needs of my experiments. Please refer to the original code for anything related to the GVGAI competition.

The code was duplicated on the 13th of January of 2021 so note that this repository does not include any modification/fix carried out in the main repository after this date.

## Heuristic diversification

The interests of [my research](http://kisenshi.github.io/research/) is widing the use of existing algorithms when these are provided with goals that go beyond winning. The modifications included in this repository allow providing different heuristics to a same algorithm without having to modify its core, which was essential for my experiments.

The modifications are similar to the ones carried out in [a previous repository](https://github.com/kisenshi/gvgai-experiments) but they have been included in the most recent version of GVGAI, cleaned and polished.
