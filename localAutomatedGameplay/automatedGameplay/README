This folder contains the files necessary to trigger an automated gameplay of a 
game of the GVGAI framework. The config file included provides an example of its 
structure. Update its content to choose the game, level and description of the 
agent that plays the game (enabled behaviours and weights).

If you downloaded the description of an agent from 
https://demo-visualize-diverse-gameplay-xqjmp.ondigitalocean.app/ 
you can include the config file in this folder or replace the contents of the 
existent one.
